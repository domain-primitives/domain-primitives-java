# Contribution Guidelines

You’d like to contribute? 
Just follow the 3 points below, and you are good to go!


The main points are:
* **Create your pull request** from the `main` branch, and you are ready to start.
* **Clean up commit history**, so everyone could read your history and understand what has happened.
* **Rebase** instead of merge updates of the `main` branch into your pull request.

Happy hacking 👩‍💻/👨‍💻 🙂
